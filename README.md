# SmartHouse
Programming first year Java Project

This Project is pure backend, that was built for my First year CW project.
The dashboard runs the whole Java package

The project is broken down into parts, Java classes,
Smart Plugs
House Rooms
Smart House
These Java classes are implemented into one another in that order to be able to build a functioning smart House system

The console helper contains all the backend code that work behind the dashboard
